= validatable_form

I wanted to validatable models without needing to create a table for ActiveRecord or having to 
override/hack ActiveRecord methods.  There may be other ways to do this, but this is what I came up with.

Now I can do this:

  class ContactForm < ValidatableForm
    form_fields :name, :email
    validates_presence_of :name
    validates_presence_of :email
  end

  f = ContactForm.new(:name => "John Doe", :email => "jdoe@example.com")    
  f.valid?

All the validations come from the validatable[http://validatable.rubyforge.org] gem.
  
== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but
   bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
